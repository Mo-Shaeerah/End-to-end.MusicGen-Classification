# ⚖️ 2. Models That Used <a name=models></a>
2.1- Random Forest 👉🏻 The best algorithm

2.2- LGBM

# 🔰 3. Things weren't adding any value <a name=things></a>

I have tried lots of models, tools, and thinking outside the box to enhance the performance and ⬆ the accuracy. 

Some examples include:
- Deeplearning Models like DatRetClassifier
- Using Optuna to optimize the parameters
- Implementing normalization methods
- Employing an oversampling strategy

# 🤔 4. Why Is The Acuuracy around 60%? <a name=why></a>

The accuracy is still around 50-60% due to the following reasons:

- I have dropped the categorical attribute instead of using label encoder
- There is no correlation between data points and the class
- Imbalanced classes, and so on
